# TO-DO:
- [ ] Make it so passwords are hidden by default for both the settings and logins
- [ ] we should add the login filters to notes
- [ ] password strength code
- [ ] consider putting the password strength in the generator
- [ ] change hide and show images are icons
- [ ] make it so when clicking on the left shield pass text it goes to the login homepage
- [ ] when there is no scrollbar, there is a green square

## Bugs:
- [ ] when you click on a login it shouldn't reset filters
- [ ] making checkbox just a square
- [ ] make it so buttons are interactible
